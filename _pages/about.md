This is Yun Deng's personal site. I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley, working with Professor [Rasmus Nielsen](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/) and [Yun Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). During PhD my research focuses on computational population genetics, an intersection of mathematics, computation and biology. 

During my PhD, I have special interests in a data structure called Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). ARG inference is regarded one of the toughest problems in population genetics, but it can help solve almost every question in population genetics, such as demography inference, selection detection, admixture/introgression analysis, and so on.
